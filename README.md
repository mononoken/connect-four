This is a project from the curriculum of The Odin Project.

In this project, we are testing our ability to code via test-driven development (TDD). We will be using RSpec in this project.

I just recently read '99 Bottles of OOP' by Sandi Metz, so I am also hoping to apply the principles from that book in this project as well. These include working horizontally, reaching Shameless green, refactoring under green, SOLID principles, and many more concepts.
